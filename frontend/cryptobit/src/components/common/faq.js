                            Cryptocurrencies should not be seen as a currency. The name cryptocurrency is a misnomer.
                            They do not serve as an alternative to the Rupee or other fiat currency. They really are an
                            asset/software that is used to write on the blockchain and for incentivising the nodes â€“ if
                            at all they serve as an instrument for payments, this use case is limited to within the
                            blockchain
                            ecosystem to incentivise the nodes.

                            The users are individuals or companies that submit transactions into the blockchain network
                            to be validated
                            and processed. The banking equivalent would be you logging in to your banking account and
                            submitting a
                            transaction to send money to another account.

                            Cryptocurrency has bloomed since 2009. Some commercial banks, including some investment
                            banks, introduce
                            their own cryptocurrencies for the purposes of settlements and transactions with certain
                            financial institutions and corporations. At the moment, Central banking is not interested
                            in cryptocurrencies, but this may change in the future.

                            Yes. However, all new technologies pose risks. There were concerns around the
                            use of the printing press (jobs), automobiles and aeroplanes (safety), internet
                            (surveillance-free communication) as well, as with many new technologies such as
                            artificial intelligence, drones and robotics. A ban is usually not a good answer
                            to regulating new technologies.
